# Limehome Challenge - Fullstack Engineer

Thanks for taking the time to solve our challenge.

The task is designed to assess your interest, problem-solving skills and experience. We want to see your code, your approach, and your talent.

## Our Challenge

Your task revolves around a simple example project:
> A prototype that allows reserving a limehome suite


We expect most people to **spend between 4 and 6 hours** on this challenge, although you're free to use more time if you want.

So **keep it simple**, but also remember to **show off your skills**. We want to see what you can do.

We expect you to submit a **link to your code** as well as a **hosted version** (e.g. using Heroku, AWS or GitHub pages) of it. 


If you have any questions or feedback about the challenge, don't hesitate to reach out to us: [tech-hiring@limehome.com](tech-hiring@limehome.com)

Good luck with the challenge! We are looking forward to your solution!

## Requiremennts

We challenge you to build a **full prototype** with both UI and API.
The UI and API should be separated as client and server applications. 

For the UI please follow this [design](./design/booking-form.png).

Please focus on **desktop screen sizes** (with a minimum width of 1440px).


### We expect:
- A reservation form following the [design](./design/booking-form.png) we provided. It should show a confirmation message on submission.
- A public **API** with two endpoints:
    - Save the reservation form into the DB
    - Get all the saved reservations

### What we check:
- Functionality
- UI look and feel (minimal but appealing)
- API design (endpoint structure and request / response format)
- API robustness (e.g. validation)
- Code quality (e.g. code style and tests)

### Technology:
The front-end should be a single page app using a major framework (e.g. Angular, React or Vue).

Feel free to use one of our boilderplates:
- [React](https://gitlab.com/limehome/interviews/frontend-boilerplates/react-ui)
- [Angular](https://gitlab.com/limehome/interviews/frontend-boilerplates/angular-ui)

For the back-end we recommend JavaScript / TypeScript or Python, but you can pick a different language as well.
